# letsencrypt-api-client
Independent command line client for the "Letâ€™s Encrypt" (ACME) API. It is for people who want to generate certificate signing requests on their own and like to have little bit more control over the signing process.

## example usage

First you need an identity also names account key:
  openssl genrsa -out account.key 4096

Then you need an key for your Domain you want a certificate for
  openssl genrsa -out domain.key 4096

You can generate the certificate signing request file with one of the following commands
  openssl req -new -sha256 -key domain.key -subj "/CN=www.example.org" -out domain.csr
  openssl req -new -sha256 -key domain.key -subj "/" -reqexts SAN -config <(cat /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf <(printf "[SAN]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:example.org,DNS:www.example.org")) > domain.csr

./letsencrypt.rb -k account.key -c domain.csr -f /var/www/htdocs/.well-known/acme-challenge -o domain.cer
